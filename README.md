## 🧩 Key Insights

### Country Analysis 🌍
- **United Kingdom**: Topped the charts for both the number of units sold and revenue generated. The UK purchased larger volumes of higher-priced products (Chocolate Chip & Macadamia Nut).
  
- **India**: Ranked second for units sold but third for revenue, behind the United States. Despite high unit sales, India's overall revenue was lower due to cheaper products being sold compared to the UK.

### Profit Analysis 💡
- **Chocolate Chip Cookies**: Drove more than one-third of the total profits. 🍫
  
- **Macadamia and Oatmeal Cookies**: Combined to contribute another third of the total profits. 🌰🍪

- **Fortune Cookies**: Had the lowest contribution to profits due to ranking 5th out of 6 flavors in unit sales and having a low selling price compared to other cookies.

### Monthly Insights 📅
- **October & June**: The most profitable months, both hitting over $250K in profits. These months saw a surge in the profit contributions of Chocolate Chip and Macadamia cookies.

- **November**: The lowest-performing month. The business should consider strategies to increase sales, such as:
    - **Advertising & Marketing** 📢
    - **Gifting Bundles** 🎁 for Black Friday and pre-Christmas sales.
